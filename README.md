# Aircraft_Turnaround_Management-Computer-Vision

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to automate tasks within the aircraft turnaround process at airports, aiming to significantly reduce turnaround times and improve operational efficiency.

Key Functionalities:

Real-time Object Detection: Employs high-performance object detection models (e.g., YOLOv8, SSD, custom CNN architectures) built using TensorFlow to identify various objects on the airfield in real-time, including aircraft, ground support equipment, and personnel.
Turnaround Progress Monitoring: Tracks the location and movement of these objects to monitor the progress of the turnaround process, enabling better coordination and resource allocation.
Automated Task Management: Automates specific tasks based on the detected objects and their movements (optional).
Alert System: Generates real-time alerts for any delays or critical events during turnaround, allowing for prompt intervention (optional).
