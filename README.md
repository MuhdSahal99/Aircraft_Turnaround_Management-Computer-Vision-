# Aircraft_Turnaround_Management-Computer-Vision

This project utilizes computer vision techniques to automate tasks within the aircraft turnaround process at airports, aiming to significantly reduce turnaround times and improve operational efficiency.

**Key Functionalities:**

**Real-time Object Detection**: Employs high-performance object detection models (e.g., YOLOv8, SSD, custom CNN architectures) built using TensorFlow to identify various objects on the airfield in real-time, including aircraft, ground support equipment, and personnel.
**Turnaround Progress Monitoring**: Tracks the location and movement of these objects to monitor the progress of the turnaround process, enabling better coordination and resource allocation.
**Automated Task Management**: Automates specific tasks based on the detected objects and their movements (optional).
**Alert System**: Generates real-time alerts for any delays or critical events during turnaround, allowing for prompt intervention .

**Benefits:**

**Reduced Turnaround Time:** Streamlines the turnaround process by automating tasks and improving situational awareness, leading to significant reductions in turnaround times.
**Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Optimizes resource allocation and facilitates better decision-making for ground crew, leading to improved overall operational efficiency.
**Increased Safety:** Can potentially contribute to improved safety by facilitating real-time monitoring and prompt response to any anomalies

**Further Development:**

_Explore integrating the system with existing airport management systems for a more holistic view of operations.
Implement functionalities for real-time visualization of aircraft movements and turnaround progress.
Investigate the use of more advanced object tracking algorithms for enhanced accuracy and efficiency._
